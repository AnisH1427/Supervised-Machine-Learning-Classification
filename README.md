# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Classification
This is the collection of the lab work & algorithm that i learned during IBM Supervied learning classification course. In this Course, I have learned and implemented various type of classification algorithm and how to do effective communication with it. Some algorithm are Logistic regression, K Nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and random forest. Behind it, I have also learn the techniques like ensemble learning , bagging & boosting, handling unbalance class and how to tune the hyper-parameters and choose effective algorithm.

At the end I have built a customer churn classification project using multiple models, You can check it on ISP churn prediction repository.
